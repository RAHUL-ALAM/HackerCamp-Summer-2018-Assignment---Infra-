# HackerCamp-Summer-2018-Assignment---Infra-
Contains the script for infrastructure assignment

The script is written in python 2.7



To use this script,
	
	1. First copy this script in the directory where you want to organise the file. FOr example if you want to organise the files in desktop copy it in desktop.
	
	2. Then run the script there. In terminal run the command - python script.py
	
	3. Now you are all done. Your file are now organised according to their extensions. A folder named "FILE_ORGANISED" will be created in the directory and all the other folders are deleted. In the "FILE_ORGANISED" folder there will be separate folders named mp3, mp4, jpg, pdf etc., ofcourse if those kinds of files exist. In that specific folder you can fins all files with that extensions.
	




Constraints:
 
	1. The organising is based on the extension of the files. All the files should have proper extensions. If the files has wrong extension(mean corrupted) then it will go to the folder of its extensions.
	
	2. The files should have permission to move and dont need any additional permission. Otherwise the program won't work.
